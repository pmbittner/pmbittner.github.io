Hello there, I am a PhD student at the [University of Ulm](https://www.uni-ulm.de/en/in/sp/team/paul-maximilian-bittner/) and working at the [University of Paderborn](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/person/105026) with [Thomas Thüm](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/isf/team/thuem) from the Technical University Braunschweig.<i><font size="1" color="gray">its complicated.</font></i>

In my research, I apply programming language methods to software engineering research problems. I am a strong believer in formal methods, as they are invaluable in understanding and specifying exactly what a research problem is about, opening multiple avenues to study and finally solve it. In my experience, finding the right model or reference frame for a problem solves it almost for free.

My current research focus are languages and models for static software configuration and respective change impact analyses. By static configuration, I mean any way of specifying a set of distinct but related things, such as all C programs induced by a C code base with preprocessor macros (`#if`), or the set of all sandwiches you can configure at Subway. In our Agda library [Vatras](https://github.com/pmbittner/Vatras), we study and compare formal languages for such variability. Within the research project [VariantSync](https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/sp/research/projects/variantsync/), [Alexander Schultheiß](https://alexanderschultheiss.github.io/) and me make software-product-line technology more accessible. Our main project [DiffDetective](https://github.com/VariantSync/DiffDetective) is a Java library for [variability-aware differencing](https://github.com/VariantSync/DiffDetective?tab=readme-ov-file#variability-aware-differencing-with-diffdetective-fse-2024--best-demo-paper-).

During my masters, I worked as a student assistant at the [computer graphics lab](https://graphics.tu-bs.de/) of the TU Braunschweig. I was responsible for maintaining a game engine for a 360° planetarium (called [_the dome_](https://graphics.tu-bs.de/projects/icg-dome)) and virtual reality research. Besides, I enjoyed working on my own [game engine](https://github.com/pmbittner/PaxEngine3) and other related projects, such as [my EDSL for polymorphic entity-component systems](https://github.com/pmbittner/Polypropylene) back then. As a bachelor's student, I also worked as a student assistant for the [algorithms group](https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/alg/) at TU Braunschweig, involved in teaching for algorithm engineering and the first semester course on algorithms and datastructures.
