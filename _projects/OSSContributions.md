Apart from my own open-source projects, I have a few contributions to some other open-source repositories.

Some of my contributions:
- __[Agda standard library](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib)__: I formalized and proved [basic theorems on `if_then_else_` expressions](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/pull/2747), some [lemmata on lists and in particular non-empty lists](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/pull/2730), a [lemma for minus on natural numbers and subsequent refactorings](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/pull/2757), and I [fixed a type error](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/pull/2791)
- __[Agda2HS](https://github.com/agda/agda2hs)__: I [extended the internal standard library of Agda within Agda2HS](https://github.com/agda/agda2hs/pull/331) with definitions, theorems, and proofs on algebraic properties and numbers, including natural numbers, integers, and machine words. Some proofs where migrations from the real Agda standard library, some where new.
- __[Programming Language Foundations in Agda (PLFA)](https://plfa.github.io/)__: I [added a paragraph](https://github.com/plfa/plfa.github.io/pull/844) to the PLFA book clarifying some confusion on modeling propositions as types (i.e., `Decidable` types) versus good old Booleans.

Some minor contributions:
- [fix crash in emacs everforest theme](https://github.com/theorytoe/everforest-emacs/pull/6)
- [document proper setup of the catppuccin theme for doom emacs](https://github.com/catppuccin/emacs/pull/148)
